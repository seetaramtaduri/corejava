Interfaces

1) Interfaces are similar to  classes but it contains method without body
2) Interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritence in java,
   since no two classes can be extended by  a single class.
3) Like  a class it can have vraibles and methods without body
4) An interface is anamed collection of method declarations without implementation
5) "interface"  keyword is used to declare interface. and "implements" keyword is 
    used by sub classes to implement methods defined in the interface .
   interface Car
   {
        static final wheels=4;
	static final color="red";
	public void cardetails();
   }

6) All the variables declared in an interface can be declared as "static" and "final".
   class Santro implements Car
   {
       public void cardetails()
       {
          --
	  --
	  --
       }
    }
7) all interfaces are public and abstract by default

  public abstract interface Car
  {
    ---
    ---
  }









7)we can create references to the interfaces.
8)interfaces can be extended.

  interface xyz
  {
    --
  }
  interface abc extends xyz
  {
    ----
  }
