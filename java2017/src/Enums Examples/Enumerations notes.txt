Enumerations, Autoboxing, and Annotations (Metadata)

Enumeration 
----------------
--> it is a list of named constants.

--> in JDK 5, enumerations were added to the Java language, and they are now available to the Java programmer.

--> in Java, an enumeration can have constructors, methods, and instance variables.

An enumeration is created using the enum keyword. 

For example

 here is a simple enumeration that lists various colors varieties: 


// An enumeration of Colors varieties. 

enum Colors { Red, Green, blue, White }


Red Green etc  are called enumeration constants.

Each constants are  implicitly declared as a public, static final member of Color.

enum Color red;
  here red is of color type
in Java, these constants are called self-typed, in which “self” refers to the enclosing enumeration.

 we  can create a variable of enum  type.

 Color r;
 r=Color.blue;

 we can compare two enum constants

 An enumeration value can also be used to control a switch statement.

 // Use an enum to control a switch statement.
 switch(r) { case red: 
                                     
		   case blue:
		 }

When an enumeration constant is displayed using  println( ) statement, its name is output.
System.out.println(Color.red);
