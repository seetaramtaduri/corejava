Exception:--- An exception is a runtime error.All exceptions occur only at "runtime but some exceptions are detected at compile time and some
others  at run time.

-->the exceptions that are checked at compilation time by the java compiler are called 'checked exceptions' while the exceptions that are 
checked by the JVM are called  "unchecked exceptions".

--->Throwable is a class that represents all errors and exceptions which may occur in java.
--->Exception is the super class of all exceptions in java.
--->exception handling:::----------

step 1:  the programmer should observe the statements in his program where there may be a possibility of exceptions.such statements
should be written inside a try block.

	try{
		statements;
		}
---if there is any exception then jumps into a catch block.

step2:the programmer should write the catch block where he should display the exception details to the user.
	catch(ExceptionClass  ref)
	{
	  statements;
	}
step 3: lastly, the programmer should perform clean up operations like closing the files and terminating the threads. the programmer should write
this code in the finally block.
	finally{
		statements;
		}
---->the speciality of finally block is that the statements inside the finally block are executed irrespective of whether  there is an exception or not.
