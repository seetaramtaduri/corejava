java.util
----------
to handle a group of elements we use  Arrays.
to handle a group of objects we use Collections.

using Array also it is possible to store group of Objects

ex:
      Person p[]=new Person[3];
 
this array stores a 3 objects of person class

program to store objects into Array


using arrays we can store objects 
but
--->we cannot store different class  objects into the same array.
--->we cannot insert and delete elements from middle in the Array.
--->no methods to process the retrieved elements from an Array

due to these problems we go for collection classes


-->we use one  class object to store another object

--> such object is called "collection object" (or) "container object" .

Collection Object
------------------


java.util package has so many number of classes such as Date,Calendar,BitSet,Scanner  

and also some other classses to store the objects. they are called as collection classes 

prior to jdk1.2 we have other classes such  as  Dictionary,Vector,Stack,Properties.to store objects but they had some limitations which not met some specific goals.
 
Hence Collection classes were introduced with some interfaces and their implementation 
classes.

All collection classes are available in java.util package

collection framework:
---------------------
It is a class library to handle groups of objects.

*****(imp)**A collection object does not store  physical copies of objects but it stores the references of other objects in collection object.

why because the other objects are already available in memory so memeory is not wasted again to store them physically.

The entire collection framework is buld upon a set of standard Interfaces.

we have the following interfaces and their implementation classes.

set<T> 
-------
 This interface has the following  implementation classes.                  	
    
     HashSet<t>
     LinkedHashSet<T>

List<T>
--------	
This interface has the following implementational classes.          
   
   Stack<T>
   LinkedList<T>
   ArrayList<T>	
   Vector<T>

Queue<T>   
--------    
This interface has the following implementational class.         
     
   LinkedList<T> 

Map<K,V>
--------
This interface has the following implementational classes.        
  
  HashMap<k,v> 
  Hashtable<k,v>
                       			
---------------------------------------------Set 
----
--> represents group of elements arranged just like array.

-->but it grows dynamically.

-->it will not allow duplicate elements and doesn't store them.

program to demo HashSet and LinkedHashSet

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

List:

-->They are like sets.

-->they store groups of elements with duplicates.

program to demo stack, LinkedList , ArrayList, Vector classes.

---------------------------------------------Queues:
-------
-->stores elements in fifo (First in First out) order.
-->duplicates allowed.

Maps
----
--> stores elements in key,value pairs.
--> the keys  should not be identical or similar.

Note:
-----
we cannot store primitive data types collections are meant for storing objects.

To retrieve elements from Collections we can use the following interfaces.

1)using for each loops.
2)using Iterator interface.
3)using ListIteratot interface.
4)using Enumeration interface.

for each loop
--------------
syntax: for(var:collection_object)
        {
	     statements
	}

Iterator interface:
--------------------
in this we  have 3 methods to retrieve elements only from forward direction and remove elements

methods:
--------
booelan hasNext();
element next();
void remove();


ListIterator interface:
------------------------

using the methods in this interface we can retrieve elements for the collection object from font and back directions.

methods:

boolean hasNext()
boolean hasPrevious()
element next()
element previous()
void remove()

Enumeration
-----------
works like iterator to retrieve elements one by one.

methods:

booelan hasMoreElements()
element nextElement()

let us discuss about the implementation classes.

HashSet class
-------------
no order of elements
can store integer ,double,float,string objs etc

3  constructors (look at API)

loadfactor means capacity to store (intial capacity is 16 and default load factor is
0.75)

50*0.5= 50.5 -->after stroing 50 elements its capacity will be i nternally increased.

methods:

add(obj),remove(obj),clear(),contains(obj),isEmpty(),size() etc

program to Demo HashSet
______________________________________________________________________________LinkedHashSet

LinkedHashSet maintains a linked list of the entries in the set, in the order in which theywere inserted. so we get elements according to the  "insertion-order" . 

we use  an iterator to get the order in which they were inserted.

program to demo LinkedHashSet class

Stack class
-----------
A stack represents a group of elemenst arranged in LIFO order

methods:
empty(),peek(),push(),search()

The  Java  Utilities  Package provides  various  classes  to perform different utility functions like dates, data  structures, random  numbers, string tokenizers, Dictionary,  hashtables  etc.  
     
 -->  The java.util package also contains one of Java’s most powerful subsystems: The      Collections Framework.     


some Utilities Package Classes

Date            
Dictionary      
Hashtable       

Random         
Stack           
StringTokenizer 
Vector          
ArrayList


 
The Date class:
----------------

     The date class is used to perform date and time  operations.   

constructors and methos refer API

program to demo Date class

The Random Method:
-------------------
  The  Random  Method generates pseudo random numbers  in  the range 0 to 1 not including 0 and 1.  
     
  In order to generate random numbers in other ranges one can use the general formula

 n = a + (int)(Math.random()*b)

where  a  is the first number in the desired range and b  is  the scaling  factor(which is equal to the width of the desired  range of  consecutive  integers).    
For example,  to  generate  random numbers in the range, say 500 to 1700, one can use the formula 

 int n = 500 + (int)(Math.random()*1200
 
ex:Program to Demo Random class


The StringTokenizer Class:
--------------------------
used to  parse a string into a number  of  smaller  strings  called  tokens.  
The   default delimiter between tokens is space.

ex: program to demo StringTokenizer

The Vector Class:
-----------------
The  vector  class  implements a dynamically  growing  array,  something similar  to linked lists in C.   

The array grows larger  as  more elements are added to it. 

The array may also be reduced in size after  some  of its elements are removed. 

ex: program to Demo Vector class



The Stack Class:
-----------------
The stack data structure .

The  stack class  implements  a LIFO(Lasst-in-First-Out) stack  of  objects, similar to the stacking of dinner plates in a hotel. 

The  plate which  is  placed  last on the stack  is  removed  first.  

This process is called popping and pushing.  

ex: Program to demo Stack class


The Dictionary and the Hashtable Class:
-----------------------------------------
The Dictionary class is an abstract class used as a base for the hashtable class.

It implements a data structure that allows a collection of key and value pairs to be stored.   

Typically the key is  used  to  search  for  a  corresponding  value.

The hashtable  class enables us to store large amount of data in  the memory  and then searching it using the key value for each  data.   

Ex: program to demo HashTable
