key benefits of inheritance is 

--> to minimise the amount of duplicate code in an application by putting common code in a superclass and sharing amongst several subclasses. 

Where equivalent code exists in two related classes.

--> Inheritance can also make application code more flexible to change because classes that inherit from a common superclass can be used interchangeably.
