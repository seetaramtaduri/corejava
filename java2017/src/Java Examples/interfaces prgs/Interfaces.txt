				Interfaces

1) Interfaces are similar to  classes but it contains method signatures without implementations.

2) Interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritence.
 in java,since no two classes can be extended by  a single class we can use interfaces to do so.

3)An interface is a named collection of method declarations  without implementation.

4) "interface"  keyword is used to declare interface. and  "implements" keyword is 
used by sub classes to implement methods defined in the interface .
   
   interface Car
   {
        int  wheels=4;
	static final String color="red";
	public void cardetails();
   }

6) All the variables declared in an interface can be  declared as "static" and "final".
   
class Santro implements Car
{
       public void cardetails()
       {
          --
	  --
	  --
       }
    }
7)All interfaces methods  are public and abstract by default.

  public abstract interface Car
  {
    ---
    ---
  }

7)we can create references to the interfaces.

8)interfaces can be extended.

  interface xyz
  {
    --
  }
  interface abc extends xyz
  {
    ----
  }

9)An interface cannot extend a class but a class can extend an interface.

10) An interface cannot extend a class but it can extend any number of  interfaces.


11)"extends"  key word is used to define inheritence.

12) An interface cannot implement another interface or class.

   
interface intf1 implements intf2 //wrong!!!

13) interface methods are abstract they cannot  be declared as final,native, strictfp,Synchronized.


14)a class which implements the interface  all the methods  in the interface  must be implemented.

15) if they are not implemented a class becomes abstract class cannot be instantiated.
